## Critical Bug Fix

### The Problem
Initial tests showed AdamWPrune achieving 0% sparsity despite targeting 70%. Investigation revealed:
1. `run_test_matrix.py` was passing `--pruning-method none` instead of `state` for AdamWPrune
2. State pruning was completely unimplemented in `resnet50/train.py`
3. AdamWPrune pruning flags were never being set

### The Solution
- Fixed `run_test_matrix.py` to pass correct pruning method
- Implemented state pruning support in `resnet50/train.py`
- Added proper flag initialization for AdamWPrune
- Corrected optimizer tuple unpacking

## Test Configuration

- **Model**: ResNet-50 (25.6M parameters)
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-100 (100 classes)
- **Training**: 100 epochs
- **Hardware**: Various GPUs (AMD/NVIDIA)
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Pruning Target**: 70% sparsity
- **Pruning Schedule**: Gradual ramp-up to epoch 80

## Optimizer Selection by Model Scale

### Critical Finding
Our testing reveals that **optimal optimizer selection depends on model size**:

#### ResNet-18 (11.2M parameters)
- **Best**: AdamW (90.30%)
- AdamWPrune: 90.28% (nearly identical)
- Simpler weight decay sufficient for smaller models

#### ResNet-50 (25.6M parameters)
- **Best overall**: SGD (74.57%)
- **Best Adam**: AdamWPrune (72.38%)
- **Close second**: AdamWSPAM (72.18%)
- Complex loss landscapes benefit from advanced techniques

### Implications
- Larger models benefit from spike-aware momentum (SPAM) or state-based pruning
- AdamWPrune with configurable base optimizer can adapt to model scale
- Consider AdamWSPAM base for AdamWPrune on very large models

## Training Dynamics

### Sparsity Evolution
- **Epochs 1-10**: Warmup phase, no pruning
- **Epochs 10-80**: Gradual sparsity increase
- **Epoch 63**: Peak accuracy (72.61%) at ~55% sparsity
- **Epochs 80-100**: Stable at 70% sparsity

### Comparison with Movement Pruning
- **Movement pruning**: Applies 70% sparsity from epoch 1
- **State pruning**: Gradual ramp-up preserves accuracy longer
- **Trade-off**: Better peak accuracy but more instability at full sparsity

## Recommendations

### When to Use AdamWPrune
1. **Memory-constrained environments**: Lowest GPU memory usage
2. **Large models (>20M params)**: State pruning scales well
3. **Gradual pruning preferred**: When training stability matters
4. **Adam ecosystem required**: Best performance among Adam variants

### Hyperparameter Suggestions
- **Base optimizer**: AdamW for <20M params, consider AdamWSPAM for larger
- **Pruning warmup**: 10 epochs minimum
- **Ramp-up duration**: 70 epochs for gradual transition
- **Learning rate**: Standard AdamW schedule works well

## Future Work

1. **Test with AdamWSPAM base**: May combine benefits of both approaches
2. **Extended training**: Test beyond 100 epochs for convergence
3. **ImageNet validation**: Scale to full ImageNet dataset
4. **Structured pruning**: Explore channel/filter pruning variants

## Conclusion

AdamWPrune with fixed state pruning implementation achieves **72.38% accuracy at 70% sparsity** on ResNet-50 CIFAR-100, demonstrating:
- **Best accuracy among Adam variants** at target sparsity
- **Lowest GPU memory usage** of all tested configurations
- **Successful state-based pruning** using optimizer momentum/variance
- **Scalability** to larger models where advanced optimizers excel

The bug fix revealed AdamWPrune's true potential, validating the core hypothesis that optimizer states can effectively guide pruning decisions while minimizing memory overhead.
